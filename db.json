  "lyrics": "Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago\nWhere she was all alone\nAnd so was I, so I asked her for her name\nShe smiled and looked at me\nI was surprised to see\nThat a woman like that was really into me\n\n[Chorus]\nShe said she didn't have no man\nRaised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)\nShe told me she was all alone\nSaid at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)\nShe said just to give her a page\nFifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)\nShe'd lied to you, lied to me\n'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI never woulda thought she was livin' like that\nHer words seemed so sincere\nWhen I held her near, she would tell me how she feels\nIt felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be\nAn angel sent from Heaven just for me\n\n[Chorus]\nShe said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)\nRaised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)\nShe told me she was all alone\nSaid at home, she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)\nShe said just to give her a page\nFifty-nine was the code she gave\nShe'd lied to you, lied to me\n'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)\nShe tried to live a double life\nLovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)\nShe thought that lovin' me was cool\nWith you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)\nShe said like it would never end\nTried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)\nShe'd lied to you, lied to me\n'Cause she got a family, family, yeah\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWoah-oh-oh, no\nAlright\nOh, I'm in love, love\n\n[Verse 3]\nI didn't know she was already spoken for\n'Cause I'm not that kind of man\nSwear that I would've never looked her way\nNow I feel so much shame\nAnd all things have to change\nYou should know that I'm holdin' her to blame\n\n[Chorus]\nShe said she didn’t have no man\nRaised the kids the very best she can (Holdin' her to blame)\nShe told me she was all alone\nSaid at home, she didn't have no phone (Holdin' her to blame)\nShe said just to give her a page\nFifty-nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)\nShe'd lied to you, lied to me\n'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)\nShe tried to live a double life\nLoving me while she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)\nShe thought that loving me was cool\nWith you at work and the kids at school (Holdin' her to blame)\nShe said like it would never end\nTried to keep me any way she can (Holdin' her to blame)\nShe'd lied to you, lied to me\n'Cause she got a family, family, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nShe said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)\nRaised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)\nShe told me she was all alone\nSaid at home, she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)\nShe said just to give her a page\nFifty-nine was the code she gave (She's with me)\nShe'd lied to you, lied to me\n'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)\nShe tried to live a double life\nLovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)\nShe thought that lovin' me was cool\nWith you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)\nShe said like it would never end\nTried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)\nShe'd lied to you, lied to me\n'Cause she got a family, family, yeah"
